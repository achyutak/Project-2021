The entire project is coded in Colab Pro with GPU Hardware accelerator and HIGH-RAM Runtime shape<br>
<p><h3>The project is implemented in the following steps<br></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: In the Pre-Processing.ipynb, you can clearly see the analysis and decisions that are made to prepare the dataset for Machine Learning algorithms</li>
  <li>Step 2: The Word_embeddings.ipynb vectorizes the pre-processed data and saves the embeddings in the pickle format</li>
  <li>Step 3: In the Decision_Tree.ipynb, the vectorized data is fed to a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn and the final model is evaluated and saved</li>
  <li>Step 4: In the Neural_Networks.ipynb, the vectorized data from step 2 is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network and the final model is evaluated and saved</li>
</ul>
