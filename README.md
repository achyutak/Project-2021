<p>This project evaluates the efficacy of the COPY model proposed by Jhamtani et al with the standard seq2seq model.<br>
There are two directories in this repository. The Pointer Model and seq2seq directories have code for <br>
 <list><li>a. Importing the code (part 1),</li>
  <li>b. Upgrading the code (part 2),</li>
  <li>c. Executing the code (part 3)</li></list></p>
 <p>Start with part 1, continue with part 2, and finish with part 3 in both the directories</p>
Run the colab sheets in each directory individually and compare the results at the end.</p>
<p>*Ensure that your google drive has enough empty memory to run this. (Takes about 30 GB)<br>
 Please use google colab to run the code.</p>
